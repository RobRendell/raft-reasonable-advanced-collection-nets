Advanced collection nets are a clear upgrade to the basic version - they look better, are immune to shark attack, and
are able to hold 50% more resources. However, I feel that for what they are, they're ludicrously overpriced.

The ingredients for the vanilla recipe for advanced collection nets includes 4 titanium per net, and a typical raft will
have dozens of collection nets. At the point that you have a spare 50+ titanium to upgrade all of your nets, are you
really that interested in flotsam any more? Immunity to shark attack is nice, but you can get the same effect by
fortifying a basic collection net for the cost of 1 metal ingot and 2 nails, so that doesn't justify the expense of 4
titanium either.

This simple mod changes the recipe for advanced collection nets to require:

- 9 planks (150% of the vanilla recipe)
- 10 ropes (the same as the vanilla recipe)
- 3 metal ingots (instead of 4 titanium)

This modded recipe makes advanced collection nets something that you can aspire to build much earlier in your
playthrough, when you are still hungry for flotsam and can get good value out of them for the rest of the game, while
being expensive enough that you will still probably spend a good while relying on basic collection nets. Upgrading your
nets will most likely become tempting around the time you're thinking about fortifying the edges of your raft, competing
for metal ingots.
